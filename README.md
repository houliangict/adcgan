This is a PyTorch implementation of [Conditional GANs with Auxiliary Discriminative Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10060) (ADC-GAN) based on the [BigGAN-PyTorch](https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch) repository. We note that the [PyTorch-StudioGAN](https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN) repository also provides an implementation of our ADC-GAN, which facilitates fair comparisons of state-of-the-art GANs. The experiments in the paper are conducted using the two repositories.
